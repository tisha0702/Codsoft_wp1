        <h3>Morning:</h3>
      <p >1 | Cleanser– We prefer any cleansers that claim to be hydrating because many cleansers that suds up strip your skin and dry it out in the long run. </p>
      <p >2 | Serums– this step is optional but we recommend using a vitamin c serum during the day. It helps brighten and even out the skin over time. </p>
      <p>3 | Eye Cream– many people only use eye cream at night, which is fine, but we like using caffeine-infused eye cream in the AM to help wake up our under eyes and de-puff things.</p>
      <p>4 | Moisturizer– go with something more lightweight for daytime if you’re going to layer with makeup.</p>
      <p>5 |  SPF– we gravitate towards moisturizers that contain an SPF to cut out this step but if your moisturizer doesn’t have sunscreen you can always mix it in or apply it directly on top. P.S. You should always use an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>
      <p>6 | Facial Oil (optional)– We like to use 1-3 drops of facial oil as a primer for our foundation, for extra hydration. Our favorite is Rose Hip Seed Oil because it soaks into the skin fairly quickly and has brightening properties.</p>
      <h3>Night:</h3>
      <p>1 | Cleansing Oil/Balm– Use a cleansing oil (or cleansing balm) to take your makeup off. It doesn’t tug on the skin like face wipes do and oil adds extra hydration.</p>
      <p>2 | Cleanser– Next use a face wash to completely clean your skin. Again, we like to use hydrating cleansers so they don’t strip the natural oils on our skin.</p>
      <p>3 | Exfoliator (optional)– twice a week use an exfoliator.</p>
      <p>4 | Essence– An essence is used to rehydrate and plump the skin. This step is optional but we have very dry skin so we include and essence in our nighttime routine.</p>
      <p>5 | Spot Treatment (optional)– If you have blemishes spot treat those now.</p>
      <p>6 | Serums– We use Vitamin C during the day and anti-aging serums at night. We also use hyaluronic at night if our skin looks extra parched.</p>
      <p>7 | Eye Cream– next apply your eye cream. At night use a thicker eye cream so it really treats the under eyes. The skin under your eyes is the thinnest on your face so please stay away from anything that’s scented or contains harsh ingredients.
      <p>8 |  Night Cream– Again, you want a more intense night cream so it soaks into your skin while you’re sleeping. Reach for anything that claims to be hydrating and restoring.</p>
      <p>9 | Facial Oils– For added benefits use a face oil as the last step in your routine. Most of the time we mix 1-3 drops of oil into our night cream, but you can also pat it on top as the last step. </p>
